# FOMC_statement

## Intro

The phrase "Don't fight the Fed" is well known in the stock market, reflecting the immense influence of the Federal Reserve, the United States' central bank. By managing interest rates and its balance sheet, the Fed controls the US economy and stock market towards desirable direction. A striking example unfolded in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a market crash. The Fed’s swift response—slashing interest rates and expanding its balance sheet—paired with federal stimulus packages, fueled a remarkable "V"-shaped recovery, propelling the U.S. stock market into a historic bull run. That momentum persisted until 2022, when the Fed’s shift to a tighter monetary policy sparked a sharp downturn.

This project explores whether data from FOMC press releases can be harnessed to model and predict short-term stock market movements, leveraging data science to decode the Fed’s outsized impact.
